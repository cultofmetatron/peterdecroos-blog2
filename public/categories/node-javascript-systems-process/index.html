    	<p>As a language made to exist within the browser, javascript did not originally<br>come with a way to do process process related tasks. Until Chrome, browser based<br>javascript was running within the same process as the browser.</p>
<p>In Chrome, every tab runs in its own process. Consequently, your javascript on any given<br>page runs in its own process. Now that node has brought javascript into the server and far from<br>the restrictive confines of the browser, We can do intersting things like run other programs from node.</p>
<h3 id="What_is_a_process?">What is a process?</h3>
<p>Much like the relationship between a Constructor function + its prototypye and the<br>object created by invoking the <em>new</em> keyword, a process is an operating system level invocation<br>of some program.</p>
<h3 id="Process_vs_Program_-_a_very_high_level_overview">Process vs Program - a very high level overview</h3>
<p>Imagine the hardrive that powers your computer. Stored on it is a long range of numbers.<br>For all practical purposes, we can think of it as a long serial stream of bits layed out. with information<br>encoded on them. At some magical location is the boot sector. When the computer first starts running,<br>it startsloading binary data from the hardrive into the RAM and then loads this data into the cpu.<br>At this point we load the master process which we call the operating system kernal.<br>The kernal then takes care of managing other processes in the system.</p>
<p>At this point, we get to your program. If we were doing this in <em>C</em>, the the compiler would compile your<br>source code into binary code which follows an executable format. The actual encoding of this binary instruction<br>stream varies across cpu architectures and operating systems. They do happen to share some<br>common characteristics. Most of this information is located in the header of the file as information that tells<br>the operating system that this code is executable and information on how it is to be run.</p>
<h5 id="Entry_Point_Address">Entry Point Address</h5>
<p>At some point in the binary stream of bytes that is your program, there exists the first instruction that<br>needs to be loaded into the cpu. The Operating System loads this address into memory and queues it up<br>for running into the cpu.</p>
<h5 id="Data">Data</h5>
<p>Constants in the process are stored in the data stream in some area where they can be accessed by the<br>Process as it runs. This includes mathematical constants such as Math.PI or string error messages.</p>
<h5 id="Symbol_and_Lookup_Tables-">Symbol and Lookup Tables.</h5>
<p>To properly explain symbol and lookup table, I need to elaborate on what is going on at the<br>instruction level on your computer. Basicly, it stores the locations of all the variables and function<br>entry points. in memory.</p>
<h3 id="Processes_verses_threads">Processes verses threads</h3>
<p>The simple $2 answer is that processes have their own copy of all the data and symbol information. In some languages, multiple threads exist within a process and all share the same data. more importantly, you cannot create threads in node.</p>
<h3 id="Processes_and_node">Processes and node</h3>
<p>For us nodesters, the picture gets a bit more complicated. The computer loads up the program instructions<br>we affectionatly know as node and loads it into memory. From there, the node program as a static set of<br>bits on the hardrive becomes an almost living thing that loads your javascript into memory and run it!</p>
<p>To clarify, the process running when you run your node program is an instance of the node program. You can<br>have several node instances running in memory. They can even all serve http requests as long as they are<br>not trying to bind to the same port.</p>
<p>Understanding processes is incredibly useful. In Ruby, processes forking is used heavily in the design of<br><a href="http://unicorn.bogomips.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">unicorn</a>. Services like nodejitsu and heroku utilize smart people who understand<br>how processes work to architect systems that run and manage your code on the cloud. More importantly, node code<br>can only run on one processor at any given time but by using features such as <em>fork</em>, you can set up a master<br>node process that delegates tasks to subprocesses it spawns yourself. Since node processes are so<br>lightweight, you could concievably run hundreds on your system at the same time.</p>
